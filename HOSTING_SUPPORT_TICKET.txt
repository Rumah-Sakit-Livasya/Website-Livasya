Subject: Request for Security Configuration Updates (Server Hardening)

Dear Support Team,

I am working on hardening the security of my website (livasya.com) and have implemented all possible application-level security measures (Headers, CSP, HSTS, Secure Cookies).

However, our security scans (grade 73/100) indicate issues that can ONLY be resolved at the server/infrastructure level. I request your assistance with the following configurations:

1. Hide Server Version (Critical)
   - The server banner currently exposes the version information (e.g., "nginx/1.x").
   - Please configure Nginx/Apache to hide this.
   - For Nginx: `server_tokens off;`
   - For Apache: `ServerTokens Prod` and `ServerSignature Off`

2. DNSSEC Configuration
   - Our DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are currently disabled.
   - Please enable DNSSEC for our domain or provide the DS records so we can configure them at our registrar.

3. Bot Protection (Optional but Recommended)
   - If available on our plan, please check if any Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Bot Protection features can be enabled to mitigate scraping.

We have already handled X-Powered-By removal and all security headers via the application, but the Server banner persists, indicating the web server config is overriding our settings.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Livasya IT Team
